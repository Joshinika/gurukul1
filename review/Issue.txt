one thing i noticed is even though i have removed the limit 100 and increaed the value of k to 50, still the issue is there. the data which is present in the top rows only that the llm is able to get, rest it is telling the data about that particular product is not present. the solution my mentor told me is since there is too much of similar keywords, vector db is not working perfectly. he told me to use metadata and list the products only, match the products, something something related to that, i didn't understand completely. help me understand the problem
